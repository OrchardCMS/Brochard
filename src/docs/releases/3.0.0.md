# Orchard Core 3.0.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### Elasticsearch Module

#### Deprecation of the NEST Library

We previously relied on the [NEST](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NEST) library to interface with the Elasticsearch service. However, due to the deprecation of NEST, we have migrated to its successor, [Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch). As part of this transition, the following interfaces and classes have been removed:

- `IElasticAnalyzer`
- `IElasticSearchQueryService` (use `ElasticsearchQueryService` as an alternative)
- `ElasticAnalyzer`

To ensure consistency across our codebase, all classes and interfaces are now prefixed with `Elasticsearch` instead of `Elastic` or `ElasticSearch`. The only exception to this naming convention is for settings, which have been retained to minimize further breaking changes.

Additionally, the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Abstractions` project has been removed, and the following classes have been relocated to the `OrchardCore.Search.Elasticsearch.Core` project:

- `ElasticsearchOptions`
- `ElasticsearchQueryResults`
- `ElasticsearchTopDocs`

The method `ExecuteQueryAsync(string indexName, Query query, List<SortOptions> sort, int from, int size)` has been removed from the `ElasticsearchQueryService` class. In its place, we have introduced the new method `GetContentItemIdsAsync(ElasticsearchSearchContext request)`, which streamlines the query execution process by encapsulating the necessary parameters within a single context object.
